## History
### Early years
Founded in November 2012 by Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee alumni Sachin Gupta and Vivek Prakash, HackerEarth began its journey as MyCareerStack a social interactive platform geared toward technical interviews. Initially, the learning platform was aimed at leveling the playing field for technical interviews for campus students via tutorials on concepts in programming, blogs, interview questions, an online code editor, and a discussion forum.

Later, Sachin and Vivek pivoted this idea to create an automated technical assessment software product that helps in hiring skilled developers cost effectively — and launched the product in February 2013. Two years later, HackerEarth launched its innovation management software; an upgraded version was released in early 2018.

### Growth and Funding
The startup was part of the first batch of GSF Accelerator in 2012, and it later secured $500,000 from early-stage investor Prime Ventures. The Bangalore and California-based company raised $4.5 million in a Series A round led by DHI Group Inc. with participation from Prime Ventures and Beenext in February 2017. In December of 2018, HackerEarth secured the next round of funding. The Series B funding was led by the Jo Hirao Office for a total value of $6.5 Million.

HackerEarth raised a total of $11,500,000 in funding over three rounds.
